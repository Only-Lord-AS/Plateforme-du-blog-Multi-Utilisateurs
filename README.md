# 🚀 Multi-User Blog Platform

A powerful yet simple blogging ecosystem built with Symfony. This project is all about bringing people together through content—whether you're a serious writer or just want to share some random thoughts.

## ✨ Cool Stuff Inside
- **Multi-User System:** Everyone gets their own profile and space. Use it however you like!
- **Interactive Comments:** Mention your friends with the `@` system and keep the conversation going.
- **Follow Flow:** Found someone cool? Follow them to stay updated on their latest posts.
- **Premium Design:** Smooth animations and a "Mac OS-style" typewriter effect because a blog should look as good as it reads.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Total control for admins to manage users, articles, and see what's trending.

## 🛠️ The Tech Side
- **Backend:** Symfony (PHP)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS & Twig (Keeping it fast and clean!)
- **Database:** MySQL
